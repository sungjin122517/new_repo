All of the Leetcode algorithm questions I recently solved involved vectors. 
When I learned C++ and OOP in school, we dealt with arrays most of the time. 
Since I'm not really used to vectors, I decided to self-study this topic and realized that vector is one of the types of STL.
Therefore, I'm going to summarize the self-study note about STL that was provided in COMP 2012 (OOP) class.

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of powerful, template-based, reusable codes.  
It implements many general-purpose `containers` (data structures) together with `algorithms`.  
To use STL, we need an understanding of the following 3 topics:
* containers
* iterators
* algorithms

---
### STL containers
A `container class` is a class that holds a collection of homogeneous objects.  
The object types need not be known when the container class is designed.

Containers in STL:
1. `Sequence` containers
   * Represent sequential data structures
   * Start from index/location 0
   * e.g. **vector**, **list**, **deque**
2. `Associative` containers
   * Non-sequential containers
   * Store (key, value) pairs
   * e.g. map, multimap, set, multiset
3. `Container adaptors`
   * adapted containers that support a limited set of container operations
   * e.g. priority-queue, **queue**, **stack**
4. `Near-containers`
   * Exhibit capabilities similar to those of the sequence containers, but do not support all their capabilities.
   * e.g. **string**

<br>

### Sequence containers

#### Deque (double-ended queue)
* **Unlike STL vector**, its elements are not stored contiguously; it uses a <mark>sequence of chunks</mark> of fixed-size arrays.
* **Like STL vector**, its <mark>storage is automatically expanded or contracted</mark> as needed. 
* **Unlike queue**, allows <mark>fast insertion and deletion</mark> at both ends.

#### Properties of sequence containers
![sequence-container-properties.png](/assets/images/posts_img/cpp/sequence-container-properties.png)

<br>

#### Methods of deque
Element access **for all**:
* `front()`: first element
* `back()`: last element

Element access **for vector** and **deque**:
* `[]`: subscript operator, index not checked.

Add/remove elements **for all**:
* `push_back()`: append element.
* `pop_back()`: remove last element.

Add/remove elements **for list** and **deque**:
* `push_front()`: insert element at the front.
* `pop_front()`: remove first element. 

`insert(p, x)`: insert an element x at position p.
`erase(p)`: remove an element at position p.
`clear()`: erase all elements.
`size()`: return the number of elements.
`empty()`: return true if the sequence is empty.
`resize(int new_size)`: change size of the sequence (by assigning new memory space).

### Container adaptors

### Stack
Stack follows <mark>last-in first-out (LIFO)</mark> policy.

Major operations:
* `top()`: get the value of the top item.
* `push()`: add a new item to the top.
* `pop()`: remove an item from the top.
* `empty()` 


#### Example codes
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   // 1. Convert +ve decimal number to binary number using a stack
   stack<int> a;
   int x, number;

   while (cin >> number) {
      x=number;
      do {a.push(x%2); x/=2;} while (x>0);

      while (!a.empty()) {cout << a.top(); a.pop();}
   }

   return 0;

```

#### Algorithm to check balanced parenthesis
1. Scan the given character expression from left to right.
2. If a left parenthesis is read, push it onto a stack
3. If a right parenthesis is read, check if its matching left parenthesis is on the top of the stack.
4. If **step 3** is true, pop the stack and continue.
5. If **step 3** is false, return false and stop.
6. If the end of the expression is reached, check if the stack is empty.
7. If **step 6** is true, return true otherwise false.

<br>

### Queue
Queue follows <mark>first-in first-out (FIFO)</mark> policy.

Major operations:
* `front()`: get the value of the front item.
* `enqueue()`: add a new item to the <mark>back</mark>.
* `dequeue()`: remove an item from the <mark>front</mark>.
* `empty()`, `size()`, `back()`, `push()`, `pop()`

### STL iterators: Generalized pointers
Iterators are <mark>generalized pointers</mark>. It helps us to traverse the elements of a <mark>sequence container</mark> sequentially.  
STL sequence containers provide the `begin()` and `end()` to set an iterator to the beginning and end of a container.  
For each kind of STL sequence container, there is an iterator type.  

Iterators allow us to separate algorithms from containers when they are used with templates.


---
### STL algorithms
STL also has algorithms that work with different containers. STL algorithms are implemented as global functions.
e.g. `find(Iterator first, Iterator last, const T& value)`

<br>

`find_if(Iterator first, Iterator last, bool predicate)`: iterator stops when a condition is satisfied.  
The condition is called a predicate and is implemented by a boolean function.


### Function pointer
C++ allows a function to be passed as argument to another function. We call this as passing the function pointer.

<br>

#### Examples
```cpp
int larger(int x, int y) {return (x>y) ? x : y;}
int smaller(int x, int y) {return (x<y) ? x : y;}

int main() {
   int choice;
   cin >> choice;

   // choice==1 for larger function; other for smaller function
   int (*f) (int, int) = (choice == 1) ? larger : smaller;

   cout << f(3, 5) << endl;
   return 0;
}


// 2. Array of function pointers

// four functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide

int main()
{
   // Array of function pointers
   double (*f[]) (double x, double y) = { add, subtract, multiply, divide };

   int operation; double x, y;
   while (cin >> operation >> x >> y) {
      if (operation >= 0 && operation <= 3) { cout << f[operation](x, y); }
   }
   return 0;
}
```
